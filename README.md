# Play wordle anytime!

Do you like [wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html)? Would you like to train or simply play to have fun whenever you can instead of only once a day?

Try it out here, then!

## How to play

In order to play, you need to [download the repository files](https://github.com/AloizioMacedo/wordle/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and run wordle.exe, or
run main_gui.py directly with python.

You can also play it in the terminal by running main.py instead. Warning: There may be color issues when running the program from terminals with themes
different from dark ones. (E.g., some light VSCode themes.)
